# lucee-aws
Lucee extension to provide simpler access to common AWS commands through the AWS SDK

At present the cfcs are available in /src/aws/, once they have been cleaned up and organised properly then proper examples will follow.

To use these you will need to have installed the AWS Java SDK, jars available from [http://sdk-for-java.amazonwebservices.com/latest/aws-java-sdk.zip](http://sdk-for-java.amazonwebservices.com/latest/aws-java-sdk.zip)
